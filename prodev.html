			<h3>Passion Projects</h3>
				<p>I really enjoy, the process of event planning. From the very first stages of planning there are so many</p>
				<p>ways that an event can look creatively from themes, color schemes and how those can both effect your</p>
				<p>menu. Along with the creative side there is also so many thing that need to get done. Without</p>
				<p>the right organization skills, and people management it could never happen.</p>
