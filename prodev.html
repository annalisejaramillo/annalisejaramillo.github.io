			<h3>Passion Projects</h3>
				<p>I really enjoy, the process of event planning. From the very first stages of planning there are so many</p>
				<p>ways that an event can look creatively from themes, color schemes and how those can both effect your</p>
				<p>menu. Along with the creative side there is also so many thing that need to get done. Without</p>
				<p>the right organization skills, and people management it could never happen.</p>

			<p>I've always been pretty cations about what i put on the internet but it never really occurred to me
			that there is stuff that I did not put there. nothing was bad (besides white pages being creepy) but i think its very
			important to be aware.</p>

			<h2>Visual Speaks</h2>
			<img src="bw-and-color.jpeg" alt="black and white & color">
			<p>A lot of what we've been doing is really knew to me so i feel like i have been seing things in black and white
			hopefully soon i will see the full spectrum of color. i think the bridge between the two would be that a lot of times
			the black and white are the foundation we stand on and the color is thrown in after to enhance.</p>

		<h2>Weekly Review</h2>
			<h3>Week 1</h3>
			<p>This week has been exhausting, mainly do too getting into the routine of things. I feel like im learning so
				much every day and Im really enjoying the work so far. Somethings there are things going over my head but I
				feel like thats mainly do to the fact that you cant know what you dont. </p>
			<br>
			<h3>Week 2</h3>
			<p>Its been a challenging week but I've learned a lot, therefor i would call it a success. There was a couple moments where
			I was overwhelmed or confused BUT following those moments was also moments of understanding (not completely but in general).
			I know that I will continue to have moments like that and I will need to remind myself to be patient. I am both nervous and
				exited to see where next week goes. </p>
		</div>
			<br>
		<div>
			<h3>Week 3</h3>
			<p>Moving into our capstones this week has been fun and also challenging. Its nice to have a community with shared responsibility nut at the same time
			i have a hard time reallying on other people. Justin is good at solving problems and Lariah is a a good listener. I'm exited about whats next. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Week 4</h3>
			<p>this week was pretty good. I&apos;ve been feeling good about things still a confused at times but not completely overwhelmed. That being said
				I was feeling a little bit hectic by thursday and into the weekend. i know that I can and will get through the craziness so I&apos;m just trying to
			focus on that. </p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h3>Week 5</h3>
			<p>Half way! thats insane time has gone by so fast. ive been really trying to decide how and also so talk to my sister about how we want my personal
			(her business) website to be layed out. and im really exited abou that. I have learned so much in the past 5 weeks its crazy to think about</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Week 6</h3>
			<p>the weeks are honestly starting to blur together.... what day is it again (we ask eachother that a lot)? its been a good but hard week, starting to run
